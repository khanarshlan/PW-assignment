# comma operator in js ? example ?

- in Java script comma use combine some expression OR to separate some expression 
  like if want to print multiple result we can combine using comma then if we want 
  to declare multiple variables then we can use comma to combine but in case of 
  for loop we use comma for separation like we separate three statement of for loop

  Example of declaration and result 

  ```javascript
     let a = 6, b = 5, c = 9;
     console.log(a,b,c)

     // output 6  5  9 
  ```
in For loop 

  ```javascript
     let arr = [ 6 , 5, 9]; 

     for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // comma used to separate here 
           console.log(arr[i])
      }
     
     // output 6  5  9 
  ```
