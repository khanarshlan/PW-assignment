# explain ternary operator in js with syntax and example ?   

- in control flow we have if else in java script we also called then as
  conditionals so then a new or we can say different syntax of using if else
  that called ternary operator there is a use of this operator in react but in js 
  we can use this operator also but there are less readability with this syntax
  -  Syntax - Condition ? true : false 

- Example whether is number even or odd

```Javascript
   let num = 22;

   num % 2 === 0 ? console.log(`number is even ${num}`) : console.log(`number is odd ${num}`)

   // output - number is even 22
```
