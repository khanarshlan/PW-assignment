# explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable in JS ?
# tell the example of where use we and make it more readable ?

- in javascript we have to make variable readable so that other developer also can
  read that code also comment make it more readable but using good word for variable 
  its very helpful for other developer 

for example 

1) bad variable practice

```javascript
  let a = "arshlan123"
```

2) good variable name

```javascript
  let username = "arshlan123"
```
