- In javaScript there different type of operators
1) Arithmetic Operators -

2) assignment operator -

    example - '=', '+=', '-=' etc

3) comparison operator -

    example -  '==', '>', '<', '>=' etc

4) logical operator -

    example - &&, || and !

5) increment and decrement Operator -

    example - '++' and '--' 

etc ...

essential ?
- for calculation the arithmetic operators are essential without
  that we can not do calculation and for comparison of data we have comparison operators also we also use then for manipulate data and we 
  can use them to compare data also for increment and decrement in values 
  - for assignments we need the assignment operator because it is used to store value into variable.
  - logical operator if we want to make any condition we can use them 
  etc
