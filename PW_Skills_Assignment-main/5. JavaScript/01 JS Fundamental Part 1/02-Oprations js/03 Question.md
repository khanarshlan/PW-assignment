# unary, binary, and ternary operators ?

- unary : In this category we have '+','-' but it not commonly used so 
          there are increment and decrement type also like ++ and --
          and we can use them prefix and postfix its like before variable and 
          after variable

- binary : in this category we have arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
            like '+', '-', '<', '>', &&, || etc these are called as binary 
            operators

- ternary : in this category we have condition operator like if else so 
            in short we can use condition then question mark and 1st value 
            if condition is true and 2nd value if condition is false its a
            one line statement 
            
            
   - condition ? true : false
