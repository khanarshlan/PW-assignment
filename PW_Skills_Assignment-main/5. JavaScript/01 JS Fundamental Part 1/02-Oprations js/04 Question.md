# precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why these concepts important?      


- in JavaScript Precedence and associativity mean in which order calculation or       execution has to be done like BODMAS rule math in java script me have some rule
 similar to this like PEMDAS rule 

 P - parenthesis 

 E - Exponential 

 M - Multiplication 

 D - Division 

 A - Addition 

 S - Subtraction

 # Importance :
 these are several factor those make this important like if we want to implement some 
 logic with mathematical calculation then this rule put a very important role
 also it help to prevent errors in calculation or logic it help in manipulation also 
 # Example:
 let x = 5 + (10 * 2) / 4; // This is an example where the order of operations matters, because without knowing that multiplication has higher priority than division, you would get incorrect results.'
