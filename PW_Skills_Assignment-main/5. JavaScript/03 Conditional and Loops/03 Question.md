# loops ? and why we need ? different types ? 

- loops are used to do task or any instruction repeated multiple times i would say 
  it use to handle task we can handle collection of data using loops , collection of array we
  can handle we can so automation also 
  
 - here are the few type of loops with example :
 1) for loop
 ```javascript
    for (initialization, condition, changer/update ){
        // code
    }
 ```
 2) for in loop
  ```javascript
    for ( variable in object ){
        // code
    }
  ```
 3) for of loop

```javascript
    for ( variable of iterable ){
        // code
    }
```
 4) for each loop

```javascript
    array.forEach((value, index , arr)=<{

    }>)
```
 5) while loop

```javascript
    //variable for initialization
    while (condition,){
        // code
        changer/update
    }
 ```
 6) do while

 ```javascript
    //variable for initialization
    do {
        // code
        changer/update
    }while(condition)
 ``` 
 etc ...

 # we can differentiate these type like this 

 1) Entry Control loops - for loop, while loop
 2) Exit Control loops  - do while loop
