- in JavaScript there are conditionals like if, else etc we can you them according to our
  need like if we talk about conditional statement its like we write a condition if
  its true then what need to be executed and if its false then what needs to be executed 

  ```javascript
  let age = 19;

  if (age < 18){
    console.log('eligible for driving license')
  }else {
    console.log(' not eligible for driving license')
  }
  ```

- here if checking the condition whether that person eligible or not if yes
