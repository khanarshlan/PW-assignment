In open source contribution there are several step that we need to follow

steps -
   1) find a good open source project like fork it
   2) when you fork that you can crate a copy of that project on your local system
   3) make changes in the code and commit those changes
   4) push those changes back to your forked repository
   5) create pull request from your forked repo to original repo
   6) reviewers will check your code and give feedback
   7) if they accept then merge your code with theirs or else you have to fix the issues
   8) once merged you get your name as contributor
