explain gitignore -
        some file like node module or may be security related files those which we cannot 
        want to show i mean to push those file we can keep in gitignore file so as that 
        if we want to push all file using git command that is git add . so gitignore prevent
        those file that and not push by git and thats why its very import to have gitignore
        while building a project
