explain git workflow -
            if we have to work as a collaborative with multiple people and with a the different branches 
            then here are the step that we need >>
            1) its good to use git status before we start a project 
            2) then we have initialize git using git init command
            3) also again for to check use git status 
            4) there so much to discuss about git branches but in a simple term
               we have one main branch and other branches to add new feature to our 
               website or software
            5) how after we work we can merge by resolving the conflict in the code 
            6) so we done all of these now its time to commit and push our code to main branch
            7) for that we git commit -m then msg this command and git push / pull etc
            8) and this whole process repeat again and again 
            9) staging area - when we commit our code then it goes to staging area 
            10) working directory - if file that we copy form git repository to work and make changes
            11) repository - its like folder that we create on gitHub
