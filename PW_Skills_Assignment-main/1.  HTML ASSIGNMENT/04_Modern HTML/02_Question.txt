* What is HTML entities  - in HTML some symbols are predefined as syntax but in case we have to use those
                           and in other there are some signs or symbols that we need for our website so 
                           we can't write them directly, instead of this we will define a character reference.
                           For example if I want to show the symbol &copy; we can use like this 


* 5 commonly used HTML entities -

1) copyright symbol           ( &copy; ) 
2) registered trademark       ( &reg;  ) 
3) non-breaking space         ( &nbsp; ) 
4) less than                  ( &lt; ) 
5) greater than               ( &gt; ) 
6) ampersand                  ( &amp;  )
7) euro                       ( &euro; )
