1) POINT [1] define accessibility -

 so in the context of web development accessibility means how can we our   
 website more accessible to different types of peoples having some kind of
 disability may be they are color blind , totally blind , not able hear anything etc
 


2) POINT [2-3] why it's essential and how its beneficial -

here is the example why it essential let just say we have someone who not able to 
see i mean its blind so if they use screen reader to understand about context
of our website then our website needs to accessible by that screen reader software/hardware
for that we use semantic tags , aria tags , we can provide extra context about text , images
there are lot of things we can do apart form this we can also test our website in screen reader 
etc so thats why its essential and beneficial
