                Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to guide complete beginners to web  <br>development with all that they
                need to start coding websites. The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert"<br> but to take you from"beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from the rest of MDN,  <br>  and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge. If you are a complete beginner, web development <br>can be challenging â€” we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You <br>should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or bas part of a class), <br> a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.</p>
